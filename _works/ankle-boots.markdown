For Everlane, 2016 was the year of shoes. With a growing number of styles, as well as customer demand, we wanted to kick off the year right: two new styles that could compliment any look, occasion, or attitude. The result was the duel launch of the Street and Modern Ankle Boot. 

The site experience, and accompanying collateral, centered around the idea of duality. With a unique scrolling experience, a dynamic color palette, and a slew of styling, customers were taken through an engaging and unique launch experience that communicated both shoes's versatility and ease.
