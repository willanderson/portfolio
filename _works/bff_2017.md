Developed in 2012, the Everlane Black Friday Fund aims to raise money and promote awareness around one of our factories. In 2016, we brought this tradition to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamâ€”the home of our Specialty Knits factory. The goal? Raise enough money to buy every single factory work a moped helmet.
