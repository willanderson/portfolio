Everlane has a website. And on that website, there are products. And for each one of these products that we sell (all  2,181 of them) there is a product page. Pretty standard.

Now in addition to all the standard elements of your typical product page (e.g. pictures, price, product descriptions), Everlane includes something sort of unique: An infographic.

The graphic tells the customer the complete breakdown on what that product cost to make, how much they're selling it for, and what a “traditional retail” company would charge for a similar product. It's one of the most distinct parts of Everlane's brand.
