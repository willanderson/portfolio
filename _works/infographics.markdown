Everlane has a website. And on that website are products. And for each one of these products that we sell, all  2,181 of them, there is a product page. Pretty standard.

The graphic tells the customer the complete breakdown on what that product cost to make, how much they're selling it for, and what a “traditional retail” company would charge for a similar product.
