I"+<p>Everlane has a website. And on that website, there are products. And for each one of these products that we sell (all  2,181 of them) there is a product page. Pretty standard.</p>

<p>Now in addition to all the standard elements of your typical product page (e.g. pictures, price, product descriptions), Everlane includes something sort of unique: An infographic.</p>

<p>The graphic tells the customer the complete breakdown on what that product cost to make, how much they’re selling it for, and what a “traditional retail” company would charge for a similar product. It’s one of the most distinct parts of Everlane’s brand.</p>

<p>In Spring of 2016, I was tasked with rethinking the infographic—both in form and in function. Below represents a few of the many explorations that followed.</p>
