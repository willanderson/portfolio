I"ù<p>For Everlane, 2016 was the year of shoes. With a growing number of styles, as well as growing customer demand, we wanted to kick off the year big: two new styles that could complement any look, occasion, or attitude. The result was the duel launch of the Street and Modern Ankle Boot.</p>

<p>The site experience, and accompanying collateral, centered around this idea of duality. With a unique scrolling experience, a dynamic color palette, and a slew of visual styling, customers were taken through an engaging and unique launch experience that communicated both shoes‚Äôs versatility and ease.</p>

<p>On a personal note, it was one my first projects involving motion design. In these pre-Framer days, I spent a good chunk of time both learning After Effects, and then tweaking key frames and animations (and the latter experience is a nice reminder of how far we‚Äôve since come in terms of prototyping software).</p>
